- This app manipulates and retrieves data from multiple Javascript Objects. Each Object is labeled in such a way to make the code comprehensible (Game, Apple, Snake, Wall, and Boss). After the window loads, the core functions are fired at regular intervals. 

- This project is a good example of:

FUNCTIONS:
- Input/Output Parameters
- Event Listener
- If... Else Statements
- For... Loop
- While... Loop
- Do... While Loop
- Switch Statements
- Spread Syntax
- Canvas

CONCEPTS:
- Demonstration of DRY coding principles (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Incrementing values
- Array indexing and manipulation
- Strategic use of comments
- Strategic function naming
- Strategic variable naming
- Strategic code organization

DATA TYPES:
- Arrays
- Object Literals
- Booleans
- Variables
